# Protein Folding

In nature there are 20 different amino acids that make up the proteins. After a protein
has been made it folds in to a self avoided native state where the folded protein can be
seen as a ”key” for a certain ”keyhole” in the body. If the ”key” doesn’t fit the protein
wont do it’s job. It has been proposed that the native state of the folded protein is the
state with the lowest energy. We try to find the lowest energy using a simulated annealing approach.
